# Infinity Protocol

The core contract is a factory which can create pair contracts as required for any token pair. Liquidity can be provided for these token pairs, allowing users to swap between them. To swap and add/remove liquidity we use a router contract to execute the desired transactions and perform safety checks. You must first approve the router address for any tokens you want to send.

## Infinity Protocol Liquidity Tokens

Infinity Protocol liquidity tokens for a pair can be identified by their name and symbol on the blockchain. This allows users to easily see what liquidity they have on many wallets and explorers.

For example the liquidity token for a pool containing SHARD and BUSD would have:

**Name** - Infinity (SHARD-BUSD)

**Symbol** - ♾️SHARD-BUSD



**Non-standard tokens**

When interacting with non-standard tokens which burn on transfer use the functions appended with “SupportingFeeOnTransferTokens”.
